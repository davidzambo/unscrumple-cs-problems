Task0:
order: O(1)
reason: we do not have to iterate over any lists, just get the first and the last values, which are
independent from the input.

Task1:
order: O(2n + 4) => O(n)
reason: we have to iterate over once the texts list and once the calls list

Task2:
order: O(n + 4) for registering the phone numbers
reason: we have to iterate over only th calls list, and we have to do 4 actions in worst case on every
iteration

Task3:
order: O(n + 5 + n log n) => O(n log n)
reason: we have to iterate over once on the calls array, and need 5 steps in worst case scenario to
finish all steps in the given step.

Task4:
order: O(2n + 3 + n log n) => O(n log n)
reason: we do 2 iterations and do 1 + 2 step AND the sorting
