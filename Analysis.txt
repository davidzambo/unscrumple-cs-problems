Task0:
order: O(1)
reason: we do not have to iterate over any lists, just get the first and the last values, which are
independent from the input.

Task1:
order: O(2n + 4) => O(n)
reason: we have to iterate over once the texts list and once the calls list

Task2:
order: O(n + 4) => O(n)
reason: we have to iterate over only th calls list, and we have to do 4 actions in worst case on every
iteration, and as I use max() instead of sorted(), i could lower the order from
O(n log n) to O(n)

Task3:
order: O(n + 5 + n log n) => O(n log n)
reason: we have to iterate over once on the calls array, and need 5 steps in worst case scenario to
finish all steps in the given step, and as we have to sort the result set, it will make the order of
the script O(n log n)

Task4:
order: O(2n + 3 + n log n) => O(n log n)
reason: we do 2 iterations and do 1 + 2 step AND the sorting
